# Project TODO

[x] Fix "In progress Done" after agent run. When agent runs it has progress bar with 3 steps. On 3rd, final step, In progress tag does not go away and we have 2 tags in the UI simultaneously
[x] SSO only login. Remove ONLY FROM FRONTEND ability to log in by email and password. Only with google SSO
[x] Folders are loading on telegram page open in frontend, but dialogs in folders don't.
[x] In vacancy review frontend ui add interactive "Original message" button that has link to original telegram message ( link looks like this https://t.me/{dialog_id}/{message_id} )
